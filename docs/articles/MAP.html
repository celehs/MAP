</h2>
<p>Electronic health records linked with biorepositories are a powerful
platform for translational studies. A major bottleneck exists in the
ability to phenotype patients accurately and efficiently. The objective
of this study was to develop an automated high-throughput phenotyping
method integrating International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes
and narrative data extracted using natural language processing (NLP).We
developed a mapping method for automatically identifying relevant ICD
and NLP concepts for a specific phenotype leveraging the Unified Medical
Language System. Along with health care utilization, aggregated ICD and
NLP counts were jointly analyzed by fitting an ensemble of latent
mixture models. The multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP) algorithm
yields a predicted probability of phenotype for each patient and a
threshold for classifying participants with phenotype yes/no. The
algorithm was validated using labeled data for 16 phenotypes from a
biorepository and further tested in an independent cohort phenome-wide
association studies (PheWAS) for 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with
known associations.</p>

</h2>
<p>To define a target phenotype, we first determine the main ICD code
associated with the phenotype. This code is either specified by the
researcher or chosen from a PheWAS code in the catalog to use the
corresponding ICD mapping. The PheWAS catalog groups ICD codes into
clinically relevant categories, such as bacterial pneumonia, which
includes different types of pneumonia each linked to a specific code. We
aggregate multiple or higher-level PheWAS codes to represent broader
categories, like diabetes, which includes both type 1 and type 2
diabetes. For the selected ICD codes, we aggregate them to represent the
main ICD feature and then calculate the total count of this main ICD
feature in the dataset. We also map all ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 using the
General Equivalence Mapping provided by the Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services. Each ICD-9 code is counted once per day to minimize
the impact of dual coding.</p>
<p>For the phenotype NLP feature, we identify the medical concepts by
mapping relevant clinical terms to their unique identifiers (CUIs) in
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). This mapping process
involves identifying CUIs through three steps: directly mapping ICD-9
codes to CUIs, mapping ICD-9 descriptions to CUIs with exact matches,
and mapping phenotype descriptions to CUIs with exact matches. Although
the first two mapping steps usually yield identical lists, the second
step can sometimes produce a larger list due to the potential for a
single ICD-9 description to map to multiple concepts. The compiled list
of CUIs represents each PheWAS code.</p>
<p>The narrative text notes from all participants are processed next.
Using the CUI list for each PheWAS code, we count each mention of the
clinical terms linked to the CUIs. If a phenotype is defined by multiple
PheWAS codes, we sum the counts to get the overall NLP count for the
phenotype. The Narrative Information Linear Extraction (NILE) system is
used to extract these concepts. From previous studies, we know the NLP
features extracted are consistent regardless of the NLP platform
used.</p>
<p>We also adjust for health care utilization by counting the total
number of narrative notes for each patient. This count serves as a proxy
for health care utilization in the MAP algorithm. Moreover, we
log-transform these counts and other features to enhance model
robustness and predictive accuracy.</p>

</h2>
<p>Using data on the ICD and NLP counts and their log-transformed
versions, we fit mixture models to each feature to estimate the
likelihood of a patient having the phenotype. We use both Poisson and
normal mixture models depending on which provides a better fit for the
observed data. These models help adjust for health care utilization
noise that could affect feature predictions.</p>
<p>To predict the likelihood of a phenotype, we compute the posterior
probabilities for each patient using the fitted models. We then estimate
the phenotyping prevalence by averaging these probabilities. Finally, we
classify participants as having or not having the phenotype based on
whether their predicted probability exceeds the average prevalence
threshold.</p>
